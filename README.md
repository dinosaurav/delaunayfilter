#DelaunayFilter

Creates a neat mosaic effect with triangles. Can base the image off a gradient or any src image.

This uses https://github.com/ironwallaby/delaunay for its implementation of Delaunay Triangles

Still in development. Local files might cause security issues in chrome (use firefox or use online sources)
